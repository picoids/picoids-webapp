# Email Configuration
# Replace with your actual Microsoft email credentials

# Microsoft/Outlook Configuration (Recommended - Cost-effective)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-microsoft-password

# Note: For Microsoft accounts:
# 1. Use your regular Microsoft account password
# 2. If you have 2FA enabled, you might need to generate an app password
# 3. Microsoft accounts are much more cost-effective than Google Workspace

# Alternative: You can use other email services like Gmail, Yahoo, etc.
# Just change the 'service' in the API route accordingly:
# - For Gmail: service: 'gmail' (requires app password)
# - For Yahoo: service: 'yahoo'
# - For custom domain: use SMTP configuration
